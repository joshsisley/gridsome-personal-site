          <p>Currently working on a project in my spare time that will provide mobile healthcare to remote areas of Honduras. I am in charge of architecting and designing the web application that centralizes all of the data from remote areas into a single database. The web app is a multi-language mobile medical records system that has been slimmed down and simplified to be used in remote areas. This application is currently being used in Honduras and has seen more than 3,000 patients go through it.</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Resource center for all employee needs</div>
          <p>The goal of this project was to create an online resource center for the existing site. This part of the website needed to be user-friendly and allow the user to find what they were looking for quickly. I accomplished this goal by creating numerous rows/sections where the user is able to sift through the different posts quickly by simply hovering over the arrows or using the search bar.</p>
